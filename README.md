# Dog Breed Classification Project

### Introduction:

Dog Breed Classification Project is an AI project. This project uses deep learning to predict which dog breed a given image belongs to. Through the entire project, you can learn to use opencv's built-in predictors, build your own deep learning models, or reuse existing powerful models using the transfer learning method. All included in this project.
